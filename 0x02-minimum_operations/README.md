# 0x02. Minimum Operations

This project focuses on algorithmic problem-solving using Python. The task is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to achieve exactly `n` characters in a text file using only two operations: "Copy All" and "Paste."

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will improve your understanding of:
- **Dynamic Programming**: Breaking down a complex problem into simpler subproblems and building the solution incrementally.
- **Prime Factorization**: Using prime factorization to approach the problem and minimize operations.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Making the optimal choice at each step to achieve the best outcome.
- **Code Optimization**: Writing efficient and optimized Python code.
- **Basic Python Programming**: Using loops, conditionals, and functions to solve algorithmic problems.

## Concepts Covered
- Dynamic Programming
- Prime Factorization
- Code Optimization
- Greedy Algorithms
- Python Programming

## Problem Description

You have a single character `H` in a text file, and you can perform only two operations:
1. **Copy All**: Copies all the characters present in the file.
2. **Paste**: Pastes the copied characters into the file.

Given a number `n`, write a function `minOperations(n)` that returns the minimum number of operations required to achieve exactly `n` characters. If it is impossible to achieve, the function should return `0`.

### Example:
For `n = 9`, the following sequence of operations is optimal:
```
H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH
```
Total number of operations: **6**

### Prototype:
```python
def minOperations(n)
```
- **Returns**: An integer representing the fewest number of operations required.
- **If** `n` is impossible to achieve, return `0`.

### Example Usage:
```bash
$ ./0-main.py
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
```

## Requirements

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3` (version 3.4.3).
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your Python files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Your code should follow the **PEP 8 style guide** (version 1.7.x).
- All your files must be executable.
- You must include a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.

## File Structure

- GitHub repository: **[alx-interview](https://github.com/your-username/alx-interview)**
- Directory: `0x02-minimum_operations`
- File: `0-minoperations.py`

## Task

### 0. Minimum Operations
Write a function that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` characters in the file. If it is not possible to reach `n` characters, return `0`.

### Example:

```python
n = 4
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

n = 12
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
```

#### Output:
```
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
```
